## Welcome

This is the GitHub organization of the Computational Geoscience group at MOX. Our main activity involves the development of [PyGeoN: a Python Package for Geo-Numerics](https://github.com/compgeo-mox/pygeon). The package relies heavily on [PorePy](https://github.com/pmgbergen/porepy).

Runscripts for most, if not all, papers that use PyGeoN are available [here](https://github.com/compgeo-mox/.github/blob/main/profile/papers.md). <br>
Note that you may have to revert to an older version of PyGeoN and PorePy to run the examples.
